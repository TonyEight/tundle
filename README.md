# What is Tundle?
As lightly described above, *Tundle* a personal project. Another attempt to build a nice issue tracking system.
It comes from:
* the needs we have in our company
* the fact that systems such as Trac or Redmine were not comfortable enough for our users
* my will to work on a new project (Yeah.. I know...)

# First goal
To make easy and simple to post new issue tickets, to follow them, to see the work accomplished by our techs, to plan this work - using workflows, notifications, etc.

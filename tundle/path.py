# We add the apps and libs directory to the PYTHON PATH, so we can import each
# package without prefixing them with the parent package name. This mimic the
# behavior we would have if they were at the root directory or installed with
# pip.
#
# E.G: we can do from "app1_hello.views import hello" instead of
#      "from apps.app1_hello.views import hello"
#
# When you have a small project, you can avoid this and put all apps at the root
# dir like in the official Django tutorial, but in a big project with a lots of
# apps, you usually put them all in an "apps" dir like we did, so it's a good
# thing to know.
